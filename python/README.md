Duplicate File Finder
The Duplicate File Finder is a Python script that helps you identify and manage duplicate files within a specified folder. It calculates the hash of each file using SHA-256 and detects duplicate files based on their hash values.

Features
Identifies duplicate files based on their hash values.
Supports multi-threaded processing for improved performance.
Option to delete duplicate files.
Usage
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/duplicate-file-finder.git
cd duplicate-file-finder
Run the Script

Open a terminal and execute the script by providing the required information.

bash
Copy code
python duplicate_file_finder.py
Enter Details

Enter the folder path where you want to search for duplicate files.
Specify the file type (e.g., .txt, .jpg) to narrow down the search.
Choose whether to delete duplicate files (yes/no).
Enter the number of threads to use for parallel processing.
Review Results

If you choose not to delete duplicates, the script will display a list of duplicate files with their hash values.
If you choose to delete duplicates, the script will delete duplicate files, keeping the first occurrence of each file.
Dependencies
This script uses Python 3 and the concurrent.futures module for multi-threading.

Note
Make sure you understand the consequences of deleting files before using the deletion feature.
Use this script responsibly and make necessary backups before deletion.

Folder Path: Provide the path to the directory where you want to search for duplicate files.
File Type: Specify the file extension (e.g., .txt, .jpg) to narrow down the search.
Delete Duplicates: Choose whether you want to delete duplicate files (yes/no).
Number of Threads: Specify the number of threads for parallel processing.

If you choose not to delete duplicates, the script will display a list of duplicate files along with their corresponding hash values.
If you choose to delete duplicates, the script will delete duplicate files, retaining the first occurrence of each file.
Understanding Threads
The script employs multi-threaded processing to accelerate hash calculations. Threads are lightweight units of execution that run concurrently within a program. By utilizing multiple threads, the script can efficiently perform hash calculations for multiple files simultaneously, enhancing the overall speed of the process.

File Type Specification
When specifying the file type, you are defining the criteria for the script's search. This input allows the script to focus exclusively on files with the designated extension. For example, if you enter .txt, the script will only consider files with the .txt extension when identifying duplicates.

Folder Path
The folder path is the directory location you provide as the starting point for the duplicate file search. The script will traverse this folder and its subdirectories to identify files that match the specified file type. Make sure to provide an accurate and complete folder path to ensure accurate results.

Dependencies
This script utilizes Python 3 and the concurrent.futures module for multi-threading. No additional external libraries are required.

Notes
Carefully evaluate the implications of deleting files before utilizing the deletion feature.
Exercise caution and create backups before executing any file deletion.
This script is intended for personal use and should be used responsibly.
